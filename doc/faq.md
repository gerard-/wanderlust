# FAQ 
Not everyone want's to read the entire documentation of Wanderlust to find an answer to his questions. The most frequently asked are noted here.

### Have you done any more work on this?
It's the intention to do all development using this Github repository. If it's not in here then it probably doesn't exist yet.

### What do you plan on writing it in?
The language it will be written in is probably C, but it could also be Java if it is to be an extension of Freenet.

### I feel this is a solution looking for a problem. Could you provide a real world use case who/what/when/why/where?
- Imagine the NSA is snooping on all your communication. You could then access the Wanderlust net from your computer at home when you'd want to prevent them from getting to know what you're doing.
- Pretend that sites which provide anonymous communication for whistle-blowers or get shut down by the government. These sites could be hosted on the Wanderlust network so the government will first have to locate them before they can shut them down. Locating a host will take a long time and lots of work. Presumably all traces could be erased before this happens.
- Think of what would happen when there is a blackout of the classical Internet maybe due to a natural disaster or a war. The Wanderlust network is more resilient and could still provide communications.

### Would Wanderlust work with something like [Project Loon](http://www.google.com/loon/)?
It should work, assuming connections are relatively stable (exist for more than 10 minutes).  It is currently unclear how quickly the network will reorganize itself if things change.

## The next questions actually don't get asked ;)
Maybe they should be?

### Isn't the routing code in Cjdns being rewritten?
So they keep telling me, but I haven't yet gotten any information on what the new system is going to be. There is no publicly available documentation as of august 2013.

### Why is is called Wanderlust?
- You can read it as WaNDRLuSt (a Worldwide Network with Distributed Routing through Location Swapping).
- It starts with the word WAN (Wide Area Network). Nothing wrong with some lust either.
- Packets wander through the network in search for their destination (but hopefully they get there quickly).

### Why did you call it Wanderlust when there is a Emacs news reader with the same name?
I didn't know that then, and all good names are already taken one way or another.

### Who are the contributors to this project?
For now it's me (Gerard Krol/gerard-/gerard_) with advice and feedback from the meshnetplan/Cjdns/Freenet communities. Thanks everyone!
